# KrishiSetu 🌾

**KrishiSetu** is a comprehensive agricultural platform built to bridge the gap between farmers, technology, markets, and services. Unlike piecemeal apps, KrishiSetu offers an end-to-end solution—from crop planning and mechanization to market access and cooperative empowerment.

## 🚜 About the Project

Agriculture is the backbone of rural economies, yet most agri-tech solutions either ignore ground realities or focus more on investor appeal than farmer usability. KrishiSetu takes a farmer-first approach, offering:

- Cooperative-based models like **Amul** for collective gains
- **Affordable mechanization**, **yield improvement**, and **crop diversification** support
- Full-stack agri-solutions including training, equipment, and sales
- Inclusion of **middlemen as stakeholders** instead of adversaries

Our goal is to build something **for the farmer, with the farmer, and by the farmer**.
